## Upcoming Version 3

Development of Version 3 is ongoing.  
In version 3, Laravel Angular Material Starter aims to be the starting point of future Laravel & Angular apps.
We won't be including a library or a behavior by default, unless we're sure that this is something absolutely necessary. We're also moving towards a recipes/plugins architecture to come up with easy solutions for common scenarios (SEO, Web Sockets, etc).

If you're interested in following the progress or testing new features, checkout the official [trello board](https://trello.com/b/tZ997reo/laravel-angular-material-starter).

## Do It Yourself

A nice article on <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/flexible-and-easily-maintainable-laravel-angular-material-apps/" target="_blank">sitepoint</a> that explains the first few versions of this repository. Recommended read if you're not familiar with the underlying technologies.

## Contributing

Thank you for contributing to this repository.

Here are the guidelines:

```bash
#setup jshint
npm install -g jshint
```

1. run `jshint angular/**/*.js` to make sure that your javascript code is linted.
2. run `gulp --production` at the end if you changed any HTML, Less or JS. Do not send Pull Requests without running this command (unless you haven't touched the frontend)
3. delete `.map` files `rm public/css/app.css.map public/css/vendor.css.map public/js/app.map public/js/vendor.js.map`
4. If you are adding/modifying backend functionality, make sure to include the apprioriate `test`. Let me know if you need help writing the test
